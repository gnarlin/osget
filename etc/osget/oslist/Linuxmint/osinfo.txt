Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that strives to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use." Linux Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software and comes bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications.

The project was created by Clément Lefèbvre and is being actively developed by the Linux Mint Team and community.
